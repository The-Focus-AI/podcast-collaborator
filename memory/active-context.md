# Active Context

## Current Focus: Command System Implementation and Code Organization

### Current Stage
- Storage layer implementation complete
- Command system integration in progress
- All storage tests passing
- Code organization improved with path aliases
- Test reliability improved

### Implementation Status
- [X] Project initialization and setup
- [X] Development environment configuration
- [X] ESLint setup
- [X] Basic command structure
- [X] Help command implementation
- [X] Command registry
- [X] Main app integration
- [X] Command-line argument handling
- [X] Version command implementation with both human-readable and JSON output
- [X] Storage layer implementation
  - [X] Define storage interfaces
  - [X] Create mock storage for testing
  - [X] Implement filesystem storage
  - [X] Create storage provider
  - [X] Storage tests passing
  - [X] Code organization with path aliases
  - [-] Integration with commands

### Next Steps
1. Command Integration:
   - [-] Update InitCommand to use StorageProvider (in progress)
   - [ ] Add storage configuration options to CLI
   - [ ] Implement error recovery mechanisms
   - [ ] Add storage migration support
   
2. Command Implementation:
   - [-] `init` - Initialize project using storage (in progress)
   - [ ] `new` - Create episode through storage
   - [ ] `list` - List episodes from storage
   - [ ] `edit` - Edit episodes in storage
   - [ ] `generate` - Generate content with storage integration
   - [ ] `publish` - Publish from storage

### Blockers
None currently.

### Recent Decisions
- Using `@` alias for imports to improve code readability
- Using `mkdtemp` for safer temporary directory creation
- Keeping schema definitions in interfaces test file
- Improved error handling in test cleanup
- Fixed test flakiness in FileSystemStorage tests

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each command
- Integration tests for command system
- Storage layer tests complete and passing
- Using temporary directories for filesystem tests
- Improved test reliability with `mkdtemp`
- Comprehensive validation testing
- Error handling coverage
- Binary data handling tests

### Architecture Notes
- Command Pattern for CLI operations
- Storage layer implementation complete
- Clear interface separation (Project, Episode, Asset storage)
- JSON-based metadata storage
- Clean directory structure
- Thorough validation and error handling
- Path aliases for better code organization

## Current Status

### What's Working
- Project initialization and configuration
- Episode management (CRUD operations)
- Asset storage with proper Buffer handling
- PocketCasts sync command structure
- Test coverage for core functionality

### In Progress
- PocketCasts integration
  - Basic sync command implemented
  - Need to add audio file download support
  - Need to test with real data

### Blockers
None currently.

### Next Steps
1. Enhance PocketCasts sync command
   - Add audio file download functionality
   - Implement proper error handling with retries
   - Add progress indicators for long operations
   - Test with real PocketCasts account

2. Add storage migration support
   - Design versioning system for storage
   - Create migration framework
   - Add tests for migrations

3. Improve error handling
   - Add retry mechanisms for network operations
   - Implement proper cleanup for failed operations
   - Add detailed error reporting

### Decisions Made
1. Asset storage will use JSON with Buffer serialization
2. PocketCasts metadata stored in episode.metadata.pocketcasts
3. Error handling should include retries for transient failures

### Questions to Resolve
1. How should we handle partial downloads?
2. What's the best way to implement storage migrations?
3. Should we add a command to verify storage integrity?

## Current Stage
