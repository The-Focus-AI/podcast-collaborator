   - [ ] `new` - Create episode through storage
   - [ ] `list` - List episodes from storage
   - [ ] `edit` - Edit episodes in storage
   - [ ] `generate` - Generate content with storage integration
   - [ ] `publish` - Publish from storage

### Blockers
None currently.

### Recent Decisions
- Using `@` alias for imports to improve code readability
- Using `mkdtemp` for safer temporary directory creation
- Keeping schema definitions in interfaces test file
- Improved error handling in test cleanup
- Fixed test flakiness in FileSystemStorage tests

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each command
- Integration tests for command system
- Storage layer tests complete and passing
- Using temporary directories for filesystem tests
- Improved test reliability with `mkdtemp`
- Comprehensive validation testing
- Error handling coverage
- Binary data handling tests

### Architecture Notes
- Command Pattern for CLI operations
- Storage layer implementation complete
- Clear interface separation (Project, Episode, Asset storage)
- JSON-based metadata storage
- Clean directory structure
- Thorough validation and error handling
- Path aliases for better code organization

## Current Status - 2024-03-31 10:30:00 EDT

### Storage Layer Implementation Complete
- [X] Storage interfaces defined and implemented
- [X] FileSystemStorage implementation complete

  - Need to test with real data
  - Need to implement proper error handling

### Next Steps
1. Complete PocketCasts Integration
   - [ ] Add audio file download functionality
   - [ ] Implement proper error handling with retries
   - [ ] Add progress indicators for long operations
   - [ ] Test with real PocketCasts account

2. Add Storage Migration Support

# Current Focus: Logger Utility Enhancement

## Overview
Recently completed improvements to the logger utility, focusing on test coverage and error handling.

## Current Status
- [X] Logger utility tests completed and passing
- [X] Error handling improvements implemented
- [X] Type safety enhancements added

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Consider adding log file output support
2. [ ] Consider adding log level configuration
3. [ ] Consider adding log rotation support

## Blockers
None currently.

## Recent Decisions
1. Handling of circular references:
   - Decision: Use `String()` fallback instead of throwing errors
   - Rationale: Better user experience, prevents crashes
2. Test assertions:
   - Decision: Use precise assertions instead of partial matches
   - Rationale: More reliable tests, better error messages
3. Color scheme:
   - Decision: Keep existing color scheme
   - Rationale: Follows common conventions (green=success, red=error, etc.)
