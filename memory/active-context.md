## Current Focus
Working on simplifying the podcast note loading architecture by consolidating functionality into the PocketCastsService.

## Current State
- Implemented separate EpisodeNote storage and interfaces
- Added note caching functionality
- Identified need to simplify service architecture

## Current Issues
1. Too many services being passed around (EpisodeService, PocketCastsService, StorageProvider)
2. Complex note loading logic split between multiple components
3. Race conditions in note loading
4. Redundant state management

## Planned Changes
1. Move note loading/caching logic into PocketCastsService
2. Simplify EpisodeDetails component to work directly with PocketCastsService
3. Remove redundant service layers
4. Improve error handling and retry logic

## Next Steps
- Consolidate note loading logic into PocketCastsService
- Update EpisodeDetails to use simplified service interface
- Clean up unused code after consolidation
