## Current Focus
Working on improving the podcast note loading system with better error handling and data consistency.

## Current State
- Fixed date handling in note storage and loading
- Improved retry count tracking
- Added proper directory checks
- Consolidated note loading logic

## Recent Improvements
1. Fixed date handling:
   - Proper JSON serialization/deserialization
   - No redundant date conversions
   - Consistent Date object handling
2. Better error handling:
   - Directory existence checks
   - Proper error state persistence
   - Improved retry tracking
3. Code organization:
   - Consolidated note loading logic
   - Cleaner service interfaces
   - Better separation of concerns

## Next Steps
1. Test note loading with various edge cases
2. Add logging for note loading failures
3. Consider implementing note refresh mechanism
4. Add note content validation

## Blockers
None currently identified

## Notes
- Consider adding a note expiration/refresh mechanism
- May need to implement rate limiting for API calls
- Should add metrics for note loading success/failure rates
